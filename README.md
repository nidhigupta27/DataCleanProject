# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
## Description
#### R script that -
*  Merges the training and test sets to create one data set
*  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
variable for each activity and each subject.


## How to Run?
#### Run the R script which -
* Downloads the zipped file at (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) location to the HAR directory inside the working directory and name the file as zipfile.zip. 
* The script then unzips the zipped file and places it in the external directory (zipdirectory) inside the working directory.
* The final text file is written back as a text file(traintext.txt) inside the working directory.
